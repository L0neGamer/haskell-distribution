Haskell `distribution` package
==============================

`distribution` is a package for manipulating finite discrete probability distributions.
It supports transformations of distributions, measurements and efficient sampling.
Plotting distributions as bar charts is also possible using the related `distribution-plot` package.


Usage example
-------------

Let's fire up `ghci` and dive right into the code.

First things first, the one line of imports.

```haskell
> import Data.Distribution
```

Let's define the distribution of outcomes of a fair dice and
compute its mean and standard deviation.

```haskell
> let d6 = uniform [1 .. 6]
> mean d6
3.5
> standardDeviation d6
1.707825127659933
```

Let's now find 20 such dice and throw them all together !

```haskell
> let twentyD6 = times 20 d6
```

What's the probability that the sum of those dice is between `60` and `180` ?
Let's find out !

```
probability (\ x -> x >= 60 && x <= 180) twentyD6
1672525186848683 % 1828079220031488
```

The probabilities are computed exactly, and so whenever probabilities are queried,
a value of type `Rational` is returned. To make sense of this particular value, let's just
covert it to floating point:

```haskell
> fromRational it
0.9149084834626994
```

Let's now compute a much more fancier distribution.
For convenience, we will make use of the monadic interface of distributions.

```haskell
> let experiment = do {Â n <- from d6; m <- from $ uniform [ 1 .. n ]; return (n * m) }
> let distribution = run experiment
> probabilityAt 36 distribution
1 % 36
> probabilityAt 25 distribution 
1 % 30
```

Now, let's sample from that distribution. To do so, we must first build a `Generator`.

```haskell
> let generator = fromDistribution distribution
```

Once this generator is built, we can query it in constant time.

```haskell
> import Control.Monad.Random
> getSample generator 
25
> getSample generator 
36
> getSample generator 
3
```

Overview
--------

The `distribution` package contains several modules:

* `Data.Distribution.Core` which defines distributions and combinators over distributions,
* `Data.Distribution.Measure` which includes measures such as probability, expectation and variance,
* `Data.Distribution.Monadic` which includes proposes a monadic interface to manipulate distributions,
* `Data.Distribution.Sample` which implements Walker's [Alias method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alias_method) for efficiently sampling random values from distributions.

In addition, some domain specific distributions and functions are proposed by default:

* `Data.Distribution.Domain.Dice` defines dice and functions on dice.
* `Data.Distribution.Domain.Coin` defines the same for coins.
* `Data.Distribution.Aggregator` contains functions for transforming distributions to cumulative distributions and other useful methods.

Each module and each function is extensively documented.
